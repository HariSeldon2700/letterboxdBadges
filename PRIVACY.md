# Letterboxd Badges — Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2025-01-29_

Thank you for using **Letterboxd Badges**.

This browser extension is designed to add small informational badges (book, remake/related, country of origin) to film posters on Letterboxd.com.  
The extension does **not** collect, store, transmit, or sell any personal data.

---

## 1. Data Collection
**This extension does not collect or transmit any personal information.**  
It does not access:

- names, emails, or accounts  
- browsing history  
- financial information  
- location data  
- user activity (clicks, keystrokes, analytics)  
- messages or communications  

The extension only reads the public HTML content of Letterboxd pages you visit.

---

## 2. Local Storage
The extension stores a handful of **user preferences** on your device using `chrome.storage.local`, such as:

- whether book badges are enabled  
- whether remake/related badges are enabled  
- whether country badges are enabled  
- whether the little on-page toggle UI is visible  

These settings **stay on your device** and are **never sent anywhere**.

---

## 3. No External Servers
The extension does not operate any servers and does not send any data to the developer.  
It only makes two types of network requests:

1. **Letterboxd.com film pages** (to read film information)  
2. **Wikidata SPARQL endpoint** (to fetch book/remake/country metadata)

These requests are necessary to display badges and are anonymous.

The extension does **not** modify, intercept, or track these requests.

---

## 4. Data Sharing
The extension:

- does **not** sell data  
- does **not** share data with third parties  
- does **not** use data for advertising  
- does **not** use data for analytics  

---

## 5. Children’s Privacy
The extension does not target children and collects no personal data.
