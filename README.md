✨ What it does

Letterboxd shows posters.
Letterboxd Badges shows the story behind those posters.

This extension adds three types of metadata badges across the entire site:

📖 Based on a Book

Shows if a film is adapted from a novel or literary work.

🌍 Country of Origin

Displays a flag + country name, linking to Letterboxd’s country page.

🔁 Related Films

Shows “Earlier related” / “Later related” badges when a film has
remakes, originals, related adaptations, or lineage connections.

All badges appear:

On posters (lists, watchlists, search, profiles, activity, etc.)

As chips under the film title on film pages

With optional compact mode for tiny posters
_______________________
🧩 Why this is useful

Letterboxd doesn’t tell you:

That The Thing is based on a novella

That Stalker is adapted from a novel

That Riffifi, Solaris, or Nosferatu have earlier versions

That Intolerance has later related films

What country a film comes from at a glance

This extension gives you immediate insight, without opening new tabs or searching.
